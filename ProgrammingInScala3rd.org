* DONE 1 A Scalable Language
  CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 18:37]
  The name Scala stands for "scalable language."

  - It runs on the standard Java platform and interoperates seamlessly with all
    Java libraries.

  - This initial chapter answers the question, "Why Scala?"

** DONE 1.1 A language that grows on you
   CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 18:13]
   =Re-READ=
*** Growing new types
*** Growing new control constructs

** DONE 1.2 What makes Scala scalable?
   CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 18:37]
*** Scala is object-oriented
*** Scala is functional
    Two main points:
    - First-class function
    - (Mostly) side-effect free

** DONE 1.3 Why Scala?
   CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 00:53]
   People have their reasons why the like Scala.
   Four of the most important aspects will be discussed in this section:
   + compatibility
   + brevity
   + high-level abstractions
   + advanced static typing

*** DONE Scala is compatible
    CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 00:28]
*** DONE Scala is concise
    CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 00:28]
    Example:
    - Java version
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        class MyClass {
            private int index;
            private String name;
  
            public MyClass(int index, String name) {
                this.index = index;
                this.name = name;
            }
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - Scala version
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        class MyClass(index: Int, name: String)
      #+END_SRC

*** DONE Scala is high-level
    CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 00:36]
    - Example
      - Java (< 8) version

        #+BEGIN_SRC java
          // Before Java 8
          boolean nameHasUpperCase = false;
    
          for (int i = 0; i < name.length(); ++i) {
              if (Character.isUpperCase(name.charAt(i))) {
                  nameHasUpperCase = true;
                  break;
              }
          }
        #+END_SRC

      - Java 8+ version
        #+BEGIN_SRC java
          boolean nameHasUpperCase =
              name.chars().anyMatch(
                  (int c) -> Character.isUpperCase((char) c)
              );
        #+END_SRC

      - Scala version
        #+BEGIN_SRC scala
          val nameHasUpperCase = name.exists(_.isUpper)
        #+END_SRC

*** DONE Scala is statically typed
    CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 00:52]
    - It allows you to parameterize types with generics, to combine types using
      /intersections/, and to hide details of types using /abstract types/.
      =TODO=

    - Static types do NOT mean verbose and inflexible, but some specific type
      systems are.

      This is why Alan Kay once remarked: 
      "I'm NOT against types, but I don't know of any type systems that aren't a
      _complete pain_, so I still like dynamic typing.”
      (from footnote 14)

      However, the type system of Scala is good enough to say NOT COMPLETE PAIN,
      in fact, much better.

    - *Verifiable properties*
      + Edsger Dijkstra said, testing can only prove the presence of errors,
        never their absence.
        (footnote 15)

      + statically typed guarantees simple, however, which cannot be provided by
        testing.

    - *Safe refactorings*

    - *Documentation*
      + Unlike a normal comment, a type annotation can NEVER be out of date.

      + IDE's can use types as documentation to do something, and give you
        informative suggestions based on these info.

** DONE 1.4 Scala's roots
   CLOSED: [2017-10-24 Tue 00:14]
   Only a few features of Scala are genuinely new; most have been already
   applied in some form in other languages.

   Scala's innovations come primarily from how its constructs are put together.

   The list below cannot be exhaustive.

   - Surface level (Syntax):
     Scala <- Java / C# <- C / C++

   - Scala adopts Java's basic types, class libraries, execution model =TODO=.

   - Uniform object model:  =TODO=
     Scala <- Ruby <- Smalltalk

   - Universal nesting:
     Scala <- Algol, Simula, and, more recently, in Beta and gbeta =TODO=.

   - Uniform access principle:
     Eiffel

   - Functional programming:
     ML family

     + Higher-order functions in Scala's standard library: ML and Haskell

   - Implicit parameters were motivated by Haskell's type classes; they achieve
     analogous results in a more classical OO settings.
     =TODO=

   - Actor-based concurrency library (Akka):
     Erlang
     
   - Scala's type annotation is postfixed, which is good for type inference.
     It's hard for a compiler to do right thing if a prefixed type is omited.

     That's why C# 3.0 introduced ~var~ to tell compiler the programmer omit
     a type which need to be inferred.

** DONE 1.5 Conclusion

       //// You can't change the value of ~msg~.

     Scala doesn't have the feature of /same scope variable shadowing/ (=Jian create this name=).
     The shawdoing above is actually inner scope variable shadow the outer scope

     =IMPORTANT= Scala compiler does NOT infer function parameter types, you must
     type them manually!!!

   - Figure 2.1 The basic form of a function definition in Scala.

   - The /result type/ is not always required to be explicitly typed.
     However, you must write it explicitly when you write a /recursive function/.

     Nevertheless, indicate function result types explicitly is usually a good
     idea.

   - The curly braces is only optional, when the defined function has a one
     statement/expression body.

   - Define a function of no parameter and only used for side effect.
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       scala> def greet() = println("Hello, world!")
       greet: ()Unit
     #+END_SRC

   - Scala's ~Unit~ type is similar to Java's ~void~ type;

     _in fact_, every ~void~ returning method in Java is mapped to a
     ~Unit~-returning method in Scala.

     If a function literal consists of one statement that takes a single

     This shorthand, called a /partially applied function/, is described in
     Section 8.6.

     For example, ~args.foreach(println)~

   - footnote 11:
     You can say ="in"= for the ~<-~ symbol.
     You'd read ~for (arg <- args)~, therefore, as "for arg in args."

   - The ~arg~ in ~for (arg <- args)~ is ~val~, rather than ~var~.
     Two facts can prove this:
     + ~arg~ cannot be re-assigned inside the body of ~for~

     + actually, in ~(arg <- args)~ for each element of ~args~, a NEW ~arg~ will

** DONE Step 7. Parameterize arrays with types - 77
   CLOSED: [2017-10-07 Sat 17:05]
   - parameterize :: Use values and/or types to "configure" an instance when use
                     ~new~ to construct (instantiate) it.

   - The type parameterization portion forms part of the type of the instance.
     The value parameterization portion doesn't.

   - The syntax ~0 to 2~ is implicitly transformed into the method call
     ~(0).to(2)~. However, this syntax only works if you explicitly specify the
     /receiver/ of the method call.

   - =IMPORTANT=
     Scala doesn't technically have /operator overloading/ (like Java),
     because it doesn't actually have operators in the traditional sense -- 
     instead, characters such as ~+~, ~-~, ~*~, and ~/~ can be used in method
     names.

     In Scala, their is no concept "operators" on describeing operations, only
     /methods/ (there is a concept /operators/, which is a kind of Scala's
     /identifiers/).

     Scala supports /method overloading/ just like Java, and the
     /method overloading/ of Scala includes overloading methods with names that is
     usually considered as /operator/ in the other languages.

   - Q: Why arrays are accessed with parentheses in Scala?

     A: Scala has fewer special cases than Java.

     For example,
     1. ~greetStrings(i)~ gets transformed into ~greetStrings.apply(i)~.

     2. ~greetStrings(0) = "Hello"~ gets transformed into
        ~greetStrings.update(0, "Hello")~

   - Accessing the elements of a tuple
     + Q: Why use ~pair._1~ rather ~pair(0)~?
       A: Because we can't implement it with the ~apply~ method -- different
          ~_N~ return different type value.

     + ~_N~ numbers are _one-based_, instead of _zero-based_.

   _The rules of semicolon inference_
   The precise rules for statement separation are surprisingly simple for
   how well they work. In short, a line ending is treated as a semicolon
   unless one of the following conditions is true:

   1. The line in question ends in a word that would not be legal as the end of a
      statement, such as a period or an infix operator.

   2. The next line begins with a word that cannot start a statement.

   3. The line ends while inside parentheses (...) or brackets [...], because
      these cannot contain multiple statements anyway.

** DONE 4.3 Singleton objects - 105
   CLOSED: [2017-10-02 Mon 22:31]
   - Classes in Scala cannot have static members -- one reason why we say Scala
     is more OO than Java.

   - singleton objects ::

   - The syntax used to define a /singleton object/ looks like a /class/
     definition, except replace the keyword ~class~ with ~object~.

   - companion object :: a /singleton object/ that shares the same name with a
        class (the /companion class/ of this /singleton object/).

   - One /companion class/ and its /companion object/ must be defined in the
     _SAME_ source file.

   - A class and its companion object can access each other's _private_ members.

   - (from footnote) ~new~ is used to instantiate classes.
     ~new~ does not have any relation with /singleton objects/.

     To be concrete:
     Suppose we have class ~A~ and its companion object ~A~. All the ~A~'s in the
     ~new A~ expression is the ~A~ _class_.

   - Defining a singleton object doesn't define a type (at the Scala level of
     abstraction) -- you can't make a value of it, unless its /companion class/
     is also given.

   - However, /singleton objects/ extend a superclass and can mix in traits.

     Given each /singleton object/ is an instance of its superclasses and
     mixed-in traits, you can
     + invoke its methods via these types,
     + refer to it from variables of these types,
     + pass it to methods expecting these types.

     =TODO=
     We’ll show some examples of singleton objects inheriting from classes and
     traits in Chapter 13

   - One difference between /classes/ and /singleton objects/:
     + /singleton objects/ CANNOT take parameters
     + /classes/ can.

     Because you can't instantiate a /singleton object/ with the ~new~ keyword,
     you have no way to pass parameters to it.

   - Each /singleton object/ is implemented as an instance of a /synthetic class/
     referenced from a static variable, so they have the same initialization
     semantics as Java statics.

     In particular, a singleton object is initialized the first time some code
     accesses it.

     =TODO=

   - standalone object :: A /singleton object/ that does NOT share the same name
        with a /companion class/.

   - The usage of /standalone object/:
     + collect related utility methods togethe
     + define an entry point to a Scala application (See next section =TODO=)
     + ......

** DONE 4.4 A Scala application - 108
   CLOSED: [2017-10-02 Mon 22:25]
   - To run a Scala program, you _MUST_ supply the name of a /standalone
     singleton object/ with a ~main~ method (you can freely name the ONLY
     parameter):
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
         // ...
       }
     #+END_SRC

   - ANY /standalone object/ with a ~main~ method of the proper signature
     can be used as the /entry point/ into an application.

   - Example:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       // In file Summer.scala
       import ChecksumAccumulator.calculate

       object Summer {
         def main(args: Array[String]) = {
           for (arg <args)
             println(arg + ": " + calculate(arg))
         }
       }
     #+END_SRC
     + The ~import~ line:
       You can think this ~import~ as similar to the /static import/ feature
       introduced in Java 5.
         One difference in Scala is that you can import members from any object.
       not just /singleton objects/

     + static import :: allow /members/ defined in a class as ~public static~ to
                        be used in Java code; _WITHOUT_ specifying the class in
                        which the /members/ are defined.

   - Scala _implicitly_ imports members of packages
     + ~java.lang~
     + ~scala~
     + ~Predef~ (in ~scala~)

   - In Scala, you can name =.scala= files anything you want, no matter what
     Scala classes or code you put in them.

     However, in general in the case of non-scripts, the Java way (name the
     =.java= file with the name of the class inside it) is recommended.

   - For the application of this section, we can compile with a command:
     ~$ scalac ChecksumAccumulator.scala Summer.scala~

     This compiles your source files, but there may be a perceptible delay
     before the compilation finishes. The reason is that every time the compiler
     starts up, it spends time scanning the contents of jar files and doing
     other initial work before it even looks at the fresh source files you
     submit to it.

     For this reason, the Scala distribution also includes a Scala compiler
     daemon called ~fsc~ (fast Scala compiler):
     ~$ fsc ChecksumAccumulator.scala Summer.scala~

   - The first time you run ~fsc~, it will create a local server daemon attached
     to a port on your computer. It will then send the list of files to compile
     to the daemon via the port, and the daemon will compile the files.
       The next time you run ~fsc~, the daemon will already be running, so ~fsc~
     will simply send the file list to the daemon, which will immediately
     compile the files.

     Using ~fsc~, you only need to wait for the Java runtime to startup the first
     time.

     If you ever want to stop the ~fsc~ daemon, you can do so with
     ~$ fsc -shutdown~.

   - After compilation, run it with two arguments:
     ~$ scala Summer of love~

   - Example:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       val name = "reader"
       println(s"Hello, $name!")
     #+END_SRC
     + The ~s"Hello, $name!"~ is a processed string literal.

     + The /s interpolator/ will
       1. evaluate each embedded expression
       2. invoke ~toString~ on each result
       3. replace the embedded expressions in the literal with those results

     + Here ~"Hello, reader!"~ is the same result as ~"Hello, " + name + "!"~.

   - In /string literals/, after the ~$~, Scala will interpret all characters up
     to the first non-identifier character as the expression.

     _If the expression includes nonidentifier characters, you must place it in
     curly braces_
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala

       * if no formatting instruction, the ~f string interpolator~ will default
         to ~%s~.

   - In Scala, /string interpolation/ is implemented by rewriting code at compile
     time.

     The compiler will treat any expression consisting of an identifier followed
     immediately by the open double quote of a string literal as a string
     interpolator expression. (=From Jian= Here is also a definition to
     /string interpolation/)

     The ~s~, ~f~, and ~raw~ /string interpolators/ are implemented via this

** DONE 5.4 Operators are methods - 121
   CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 02:58]
   Scala provides a rich set of operators for its basic types.
   These operators are actually just a nice syntax for ordinary method calls.

   - For example,
     + ~1 + 2~ is actually ~1.+(2)~.
       In fact, ~Int~ contains several /overloaded/ ~+~ methods that take
       different parameter types.

     + ~s~ is a ~String~.
       ~s.indexOf('o')~ can be written as ~s indexOf 'o'~,
       ~s.indexOf('o', 5)~ can be written as ~s indexOf ('o', 5)~

     + ~7.toLong~ can be written as ~7 toLong~

     + ~(2.0).unary_-~ is usually written as ~-0.2~

   - In Scala operators are not special language syntax; any method can be an
     operator.

   - The _ONLY_ identifiers that can be used as /prefix operators/ are ~+~, ~-~,
     ~!~, and ~~~.

     This is why when you see, for example, ~p.unary_*~, you cannot write it as
     ~*p~. It ought to be written as ~*.p~

   - Convetions for no parameter methods:
     + always have ~()~ when a method is used for side effect.
     + call a method without taking ~()~ when no side effect.

** DONE 5.5 Arithmetic operations - 124

   - =TODO= =RE-READ=
     The floating-point remainder you get with ~%~ is NOT the one defined by the
     IEEE 754 standard.

     The IEEE 754 remainder uses rounding division, not truncating division, in
     calculating the remainder, so it is quite different from the integer
     remainder operation.

     If you really want an IEEE 754 remainder, you can call ~IEEEremainder~ on
     ~scala.math~, as in:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       math.IEEEremainder(11.0, 4.0)
       // -1.0
     #+END_SRC

   - The numeric types also offer unary prefix operators ~+~ (method ~unary_+~)
     and ~-~ (method ~unary_-~), which allow you to indicate whether a literal
     number is positive or negative, as in ~-3~ or ~+4.0~.   
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       val neg = 1 + -3
       // -2

     | (all assignment operators)     |

   - ONE EXCEPTION: /assignment operators/, which end in an equals character:
     If an operator ends in an equals character (~=~), and the operator is NOT
     one of the comparison operators ~<=~, ~>=~, ~==~, or ~!=~, then the
     precedence of the operator is the same as that of simple assignment (~=~).

   - The /associativity/ of an operator in Scala is determined by its
     _LAST character_.

   - NO MATTER what /associativity/ an operator has, however, its operands are
     _always evaluated left to right_.

   - If ~a~ is an expression that is _NOT_ just a simple reference to an
     immutable value, then ~a ::: b~ is more precisely treated as the following
     block: ~{ val x = a; b.:::(x) }~

   - This /associativity/ rule also plays a role when multiple operators of the
     _SAME precedence_ appear side by side.

     If the methods _end in_ ~:~, they are _grouped right to left_;
     otherwise, they are _grouped left to right_.
       For example, ~a ::: b ::: c~ is treated as ~a ::: (b ::: c)~.
     But ~a * b * c~, by contrast, is treated as ~(a * b) * c~.

   - In Scala, _EVERY_ /auxiliary constructor/ _MUST_ invoke another constructor
     of the same class _as its FIRST action_.
       In other words, the first statement in every /auxiliary constructor/ in
     every Scala class will have the form ~this(...)~.

     The net effect of this rule is that _EVERY_ constructor invocation in Scala
     will _end up eventually_ calling the /primary constructor/ of the class.

     The /primary constructor/ is thus _the single point of entry_ of a class.

   - The rule about constructor for Scala is more restrictive than Java's:
     + In Java, a constructor must either invoke another constructor of the same
       class, or directly invoke a constructor of the superclass, as its first
       action.

     + In Scala, ONLY the /primary constructor/ can invoke a superclass
       constructor.

   CLOSED: [2017-10-07 Sat 17:39]
   - alphanumeric identifier :: its definition is like the /identifier/ defintion
        of the C language.

        Only one difference, you can use ~$~ as a letter.
        _However_, ~$~ is used by the compiler. Programmers shouldn't create
        identifiers with ~$~ inside, which might lead to name clashes with
        identifiers generated by the Scala compiler. Though this will never
        affect the process of compilation, it will affect the correctness of the
        result of compilation.

   - Camel-case names of /fields/, /method parameters/, /local variables/, and
     /functions/ should start with a _lower case_ letter;

     Camel-case names of /classes/ and /traits/ should start with an _UPPER case_
     letter.

   - You shouldn't use _trailing underscore identifiers_, for some reason
     (=TODO=) ~val name_: Int = 1~ will trigger an compilation error, and the
     compiler thinks you create a name ~name_:~, rather than ~name_~.

     In this case, if you still want to create a ~name_~ name, you must add a
     space before ~:~.

   - ~val~'s remain constant after it is initialized, it is still a variable.
     For example, method parameters are used as ~val~ (though not write ~val~
     explicitly), the change everytime you call this method.

     A constant is more permanent. The naming convention of constant in Scala is
     the same as class names.

     Comparison between Java and Scala constant names convetion:
     + Java - ~X_OFFSET~

     + Scala - ~XOffset~

   - operator characters :: printable ASCII characters such as +, :, ?, ~ or #.

        =TODO= =Re-Read=
        Footnote 7: More precisely, an operator character belongs to the Unicode
        set of mathematical symbols(Sm) or other symbols(So), or to the 7-bit
        ASCII characters that are not letters, digits, parentheses, square
        brackets, curly braces, single or double quote, or an underscore,
        period, semi-colon, comma, or back tick character.

   - operator identifier :: it consists of one or more operator characters.

   - The Scala compiler will internally "mangle" /operator identifiers/ to turn
     them into legal Java identifiers with embedded ~$~ characters.

     For instance, the identifier ~:->~ would be represented internally as
     ~$colon$minus$greater~.

     If you ever wanted to access this identifier from Java code, you'd need to
     use this internal representation.

   - Because operator identifiers in Scala can become arbitrarily long, there is
     a small difference between Java and Scala. =TODO= =WHY=

     In Java, the input ~x<-y~ would be parsed as _four_ lexical symbols, so it
     would be equivalent to ~x < - y~.

     In Scala, ~<-~ would be parsed as a single identifier, giving ~x <- y~.

     If you want the first interpretation, you need to separate the ~<~ and ~-~
     the characters by a space.

     NOT a problem in practice.
     =TODO=

   - mixed identifier :: consists of an /alphanumeric identifier/, which is
        followed by an _underscore_ and an /operator identifier/.

        =TODO= MUST be an underscore and an operator indentifier ???????

     For example,
     + ~unary_+~
     + ~myvar_=~

     In addition, the /mixed identifier/ form ~myvar_=~ is generated by the Scala
     compiler to support /properties/ (more on that in Chapter 18).
     =TOOD=

   - literal identifier :: an ARBITRARY string enclosed in _back ticks_.
        For instance, ~`x`~, ~`<clinit>`~, ~`yield`~

     A typical use case is accessing the static ~yield~ method in Java's ~Thread~
     class. You cannot write ~Thread.yield()~ in Scala because ~yield~ is a
     /reserved word/ in Scala. However, you can still name the method in back
     ticks, e.g., ~Thread.`yield`()~.

  Programmers can use these result values to simplify their code, just as they

      Lastly, you close the resource in a finally block. This idiom is the same
      in Scala as in Java;

*** DONE Yielding a value
    CLOSED: [2017-10-09 Mon 04:02]
    - If you're familiar with Java, it’s worth noting that Scala’s behavior differs
      from Java only because Java’s ~try-finally~ does not result in a value. As
      in Java, if a finally clause includes an explicit return statement, or
      throws an exception, that return value or exception will “overrule” any
      previous one that originated in the try block or one of its catch clauses.
      For example, given this, rather contrived, function definition:
      =See Java specification or the book Java Puzzler=
      + code
        #+BEGIN_SRC scala
          // Always return 2

   - The is no keyword ~break~ in Scala.
     If you still want to use it, use the class ~Breaks~ in the package
     ~scala.util.control~, which offers a ~break~ method and can be used to exit
     an enclosing block that's marked with ~breakable~.

     For exmaple, a program that repeatedly read non-empty lines from the
     standard input.

   - The ~Breaks~ class implements ~break~ _by throwing an exception_ that is

    CLOSED: [2017-10-09 Mon 05:16]
    - Scala allows you to indicate that _the LAST parameter_ to a function may be
      _repeated_.

      Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        def echo(args: String*) =
          for (arg <- args) println(arg)

        // echo: (args: String*)Unit

      Inside the function, the type of the repeated parameter is an ~Array~ of
      the declared type of the parameter.

    - You can also pass an array of the appropriate type paremeters to a function
      that accept repeated paraemters. To accomplish this, use ~_*~
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        val arr = Array("What's", "up", "doc?")

        echo(arr: _*)

    instruction set makes implementing more advanced forms of tail recursion
    very difficult.

    - Scala only optimizes directly recursive calls.
      It can't optimize mutually recursive functions.

    - You also won't get a tail-call optimization if the final call goes to a
      function value.

   - The ~height~ method returns the number of lines in ~contents~.

   - From the performance point of view:
     + A /field/ is pre-computed and no change in the future, it is usually
       faster than a /method/.
         At the same time, it requires memory to save the pre computed values.

     + In Scala, /fields/ and /methods/ belong to the same namespace.

   - The second point above

     This rule provides useful information for the compiler that helps avoid
     some hard-to-catch errors and makes system evolution safer.

   - The ~override~ convention is even more important when it comes to system
     evolution.

     For instance, suppose you have a base class, and a subclass. Later you add a
     method named ~foo~ to the base class (a evolution). If, accidently, the
     subclass has a method of this name already, a compiler error will be
     issued for the reason that this subclass method doesn't have ~override~ --
     a subclass method CANNOT override a exist-in-the-future method of the /base

   - If what you're after is primarily _code reuse_, you should in general prefer
     composition to inheritance.
     + Only inheritance suffers from the /fragile base class problem/, in which
       you can inadvertently break subclasses by changing a superclass.

     + If you want to use /inheritance/, you need to consider two questions:
       1. whether it models an *is-a* relationship.
          footnote 8: Meyers, Effective C++ [Mey91]

       2. whether clients will want to use the subclass type as a superclass type.
          footnote 9: Eckel, Thinking in Java [Eck98]

   - Example:
     In the former section, we define ~LineElement~ as a subclass of
     ~ArrayElement~ to re-use ~ArrayElement~'s definition of ~contents~.

     It is better to define ~LineElement~ as a direct subclass of ~Element~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       class LineElement(s: String) extends Element {
         val contents = Array(s)

     + If ~LineElement~ extends ~ArrayElement~, this is a /inheritance relation/

       forcus on the /composition relation/ between ~LineElement~ and ~Array~.

  CLOSED: [2017-10-12 Thu 00:16]
  In Scala, every class inherits from a common superclass named ~Any~.

  Scala also defines some interesting classes at the _bottom_ of the hierarchy,
  ~Null~ and ~Nothing~, which essentially act as common subclasses.

  ~Nothing~ is a subclass of ~Null~.

** DONE 11.1 Scala's class hierarchy - 246
   CLOSED: [2017-10-11 Wed 18:39]
   - The ~hashCode~ method has an alias ~##~

   - The ~==~ method is essentially the same as ~equals~ and ~!=~ is _ALWAYS_ the
     negation of ~equals~.

     footnote 1:
     The only case where ~==~ does not directly call ~equals~ is for Java's boxed
     numeric classes, such as ~Integer~ or ~Long~. In Java, a ~new Integer(1)~
     does NOT equal a ~new Long(1)~ even though for /primitive values/ ~1 == 1L~.
       Since Scala is a more regular language than Java, it was necessary to
     correct this discrepancy by special-casing the ~==~ method for these classes.
     Likewise, the ~##~ method provides a Scala version of hashing that is the
     same as Java’s ~hashCode~, except for boxed numeric types, where it works
     consistently with ~==~. For instance ~new Integer(1)~ and ~new Long(1)~
     hash the same with ~##~ even though their Java ~hashCodes~ are different.

     =From Jian= this is NOT always the case if in Java due to its /boxed type/
     and /reference equality/.

   - ~Any~ has two direct subclasses:
     + ~AnyVal~ :: the parent class of /value classes/.
                   
       There are _NINE_ /value classes/ built into Scala, they are subtypes of
       ~scala.AnyVal~, but they do NOT subclass each other:
       * ~Byte~
       * ~Short~
       * ~Char~
       * ~Int~
       * ~Long~
       * ~Float~
       * ~Double~
       * ~Boolean~
       * ~Unit~

       The instances of /these classes/ are all written as /literals/ in Scala.
       You cannot create instances of these classes using ~new~. This is enforced
       by the "trick" that value classes are all defined to be both ~abstract~
       and ~final~.

     + ~AnyRef~ :: the base class of all /reference classes/ in Scala.

       This is just an alias for class ~java.lang.Object~. So classes written in
       Java, as well as classes written in Scala, all inherit from ~AnyRef~.

       One way to think of ~java.lang.Object~, therefore, is as the way ~AnyRef~
       is implemented on the Java platform. Thus, although you can use ~Object~
       and ~AnyRef~ interchangeably in Scala programs on the Java platform,
       _the recommended style is to use ~AnyRef~ everywhere_.

** DONE 11.2 How primitives are implemented - 250
   CLOSED: [2017-10-11 Wed 19:01]
   - Scala stores integers in the same way as Java -- as 32-bit words.
     This is important for efficiency on the JVM and also for interoperability
     with Java libraries.

     Integers of type ~Int~ are converted transparently to "boxed integers" of
     type ~java.lang.Integer~ whenever necessary. This is like /auto-boxing/ in
     Java 5+ and it is indeed quite similar.
       There's _ONE crucial difference_ though: /Boxing/ in Scala is much less
       visible than /boxing/ in Java -- you cannot distinguish them in Scala.

   - _Java is NOT a pure object-oriented language_.
     There is a difference between /primitive types/ and /reference types/ that
     can be clearly observed.

   - For /reference types/ other than Java's boxed numeric types, ~==~ is treated
     as an alias of the ~equals~ method inherited from ~Object~.

     ~true~ in Scala,
     but ~false~ in Java (~equals~ returns ~true~):

   - Class ~Null~ is the type of the ~null~ reference; it is a subclass of every
     reference class (i.e., every class that itself inherits from ~AnyRef~).

     ~Null~ is NOT compatible with /value types/.

   - ~Nothing~ is at the very bottom of Scala's class hierarchy; it is a subtype
     of every other type. However, there exist NO values of this type whatsoever.

     Q: Why does it make sense to have a type without values?
     A: (partial) As discussed in Section 7.4, one use of ~Nothing~ is that is

** DONE 12.1 How traits work - 257
   CLOSED: [2017-10-12 Thu 00:37]
   - A trait does NOT declare a superclass, so like a class, it has the default
     superclass of ~AnyRef~.

   - /traits/ can do anything calls can do, with only _TWO exceptions_:
     + a trait cannot have any /class parameter/ (i.e. parameters passed to the
       primary constructor of a class).

     + Whereas in classes, the ~super~ calls are _statically_ bound; in traits,
       they are dynamically bound.

       ~super~ is undefined when you define the ~trait~ that includes it.
       Rather, the implementation to invoke will be determined anew each time
       the trait is mixed into a concrete class.

       =TODO=
       This curious behavior of super is key to allowing traits to work as
       /stackable modifications/, which will be described in Section 12.5.

   - 

   - To enrich an interface using traits, simply define a trait with a small number
     of abstract methods -- the thin part of the trait's interface -- and a
     potentially large number of concrete methods, all implemented in terms of
     the abstract methods. Then you can mix the enrichment trait into a class,
     implement the thin portion of the interface, and end up with a class that
     has all of the rich interface available.

   CLOSED: [2017-10-12 Thu 03:04]
   - One major use of traits:
     turning a thin interface into a rich one.

   - Now turn to a second major use of traits:
     providing stackable modifications to classes.

   - Traits let you modify the methods of a class, and they do so in a way that
     allows you to stack those modifications with each other (order matters).

   - As an example,
     _consider stacking modifications to a queue of integers_.

     + Two basic operations to the queue (FIFO):
       * ~put~
       * ~get~

     + Code:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         abstract class IntQueue {
           def get(): Int
           def put(x: Int)
         }

         import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer

         class BasicIntQueue extends IntQueue {
           private val buf = new ArrayBuffer[Int]
           def get() = buf.remove(0)
           def put(x: Int) = { buf += x }
         }
       #+END_SRC

     + Given a class that implements such a queue, you could define traits to
       perform modifications such as these:
       * ~Doubling~: double all integers that are put in the queue
       * ~Incrementing~: increment all integers that are put in the queue
       * ~Filtering~: filter out negative integers from a queue

       These THREE traits represent /modifications/, because they modify the
       behavior of an underlying queue class rather than defining a full queue
       class themselves.

       The three are also /stackable/ -- you can select any of the three you
       like, mix them into a class, and obtain a new class that has all of the
       modifications you chose.

     + The implementations of three traits.
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
         trait Doubling extends IntQueue {
           abstract override def put(x: Int) = { super.put(2 * x) }
         }

         trait Incrementing extends IntQueue {
           abstract override def put(x: Int) = { super.put(x + 1) }
         }

         trait Filtering extends IntQueue {
           abstract override def put(x: Int) = {
             if (x >= 0) super.put(x)
           }
         }
       #+END_SRC

       * If a /trait/ extends a class A, _ONLY_ classes that extends A can mix in
         this /trait/. For instance, you can mix ~Doubling~ into ~BasicIntQueue~,
         but NOT into ~Rational~.

       * If a /trait/ can have ~super~ call on a method declared ~abstract~.
         =TODO= =???=
         - Such calls are illegal for normal /classes/ because they will
           certainly fail at run time.
           =From Jian= since the current method ~m~ is ~abstract~, the ~m~
           method of the superclass is also ~abstract~.

         - For a trait, however, since ~super~ calls is dynamically bound, such a
           call can actually succeed.

         In this example the ~super~ call in ~trait Doubling~ will work so long
         as _the trait is mixed in after another trait or class that gives a
         concrete definition to the method_.

         This arrangement is frequently needed with traits that implement stackable
         modifications. To tell the compiler you are doing this on purpose, you
         must mark such methods as ~abstract override~. _This combination of
         modifiers is only allowed for members of traits, not classes_, and it
         means that the trait must be mixed into some class that has a concrete
         definition of the method in question.

           queue.get()
           // Int = 2
         #+END_SRC

     + Rules (roughly): =TODO= see the next section for details
       + traits further to the right take effect first.
         When you call a method on a class with mixins, the method in the trait
         furthest to the right is called first.

       + If that method calls ~super~, it invokes the method in the next trait to
         its left, and so on.

   - Since _the order of traits is significant_,
     you must keep eyes open for opportunities to arrange code as stackable
     modifications.

   CLOSED: [2017-10-12 Thu 03:36]
   Q: Use /traits/ or /abstract classes/?
   A: NO firm rules, only guidelines to consider:

   - If the behavior will _NOT be reused_, then make it a /concrete class/. It
     is not reusable behavior after all.

   - If it might be reused in _multiple, unrelated classes_, make it a /trait/.
     Only traits can be mixed into different parts of the class hierarchy.

   - If you want to _inherit from it in Java code_, use an /abstract class/.
     Since traits with code do not have a close Java analog, it tends to be
     awkward to inherit from a trait in a Java class.

     Inheriting from a Scala class, meanwhile, is exactly like inheriting from a
     Java class.

     _As one EXCEPTION_,
     _a /Scala trait/ with only abstract members translates directly to a /Java
     interface/_, so you should feel free to define such traits even if you
     expect Java code to inherit from it.
     =TODO= =IMPORTANT=
     See Chapter 31 for more information on working with Java and Scala together.

   - If you plan to _distribute it in compiled form_, and you expect outside groups
     to write classes inheriting from it, you might lean towards using an
     /abstract class/.

     The issue is that when a trait gains or loses a member, any classes that
     inherit from it must be recompiled, even if they have not changed.

     If outside clients will only call into the behavior, instead of inheriting
     from it, then using a trait is fine.

   - If you _still do not know, after considering the above_, then START BY making
     it as a /trait/. You can always change it later, and in general using a
     /trait/ _keeps more options open_.

   - Any kind of definition that you can put inside a class can also be at the
     top level of a package.

     + Q: How to do it?

     + A: put the definitions in a /package object/.

   - Each /package/ is allowed to have one /package object/.
     Any definitions placed in a /package object/ are considered members of the
     /package/ itself.

   - Example:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       // In file bobsdelights/package.scala
       package object bobsdelights {
         def showFruit(fruit: Fruit) = {
           import fruit._
           println(name + "s are " + color)
         }
       }

       // In file PrintMenu.scala
       package printmenu
       import bobsdelights.Fruits
       import bobsdelights.showFruit
       object PrintMenu {
         def main(args: Array[String]) = {
           for (fruit <Fruits.
                menu) {
             showFruit(fruit)
           }
         }
       }
     #+END_SRC

   - Package objects are frequently used to hold
     + package-wide type aliases (Chapter 20)
     + implicit conversions (Chapter 21).

     The top-level ~scala~ package has a /package object/, and its definitions
     are available to all Scala code.

   - /Package objects/ are compiled to class files named ~package.class~ that are
     the located in the directory of the package that they augment.

     It's useful to _keep the same convention_ for source files.
     So you would typically put the source file of the /package object/
     ~bobsdelights~ of Listing 13.14 into a file named =package.scala= that
     resides in the ~bobsdelights~ directory.

     #+END_SRC
     The ~ensuring~ method is called on a implicitly conversion of the ~Element~

    A /sequence of cases/ (i.e., alternatives) in curly braces can be used

    - Only indicate the type doesn't tell the compiler a /partial function/

    - Stackoverflow (=From Jian=):
      why scala doesn't have a built-in ~PartialFunctionN~?

    - Use the ~isDefineAt~ method (of a type ~PartialFunction~ value) and a input
      pattern to check if a pattern is supported by a /partial function/.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        second.isDefineAt(List(5, 6, 7))

    - What does scala do to a /partial function/ definition?

      This translation takes effect _whenever_ the declared type of a function
      literal is ~PartialFunction~.

      If the declared type is just ~Function1~, or is missing, the /function
      literal/ is instead translated to a /complete function/.

    - Of course, you should work with /complete functions/ whenever possible,
      because /partial functions/ allow for runtime errors that the compiler
      cannot help you with.

      However,
      + there are context that you know some patterns will never show up, and
        then you /partial functions/.

      + Alternatively, you might be using a framework that expects /partial

   - Lists are /homogeneous/.

   - The list type in Scala is /covariant/.

     /convariant/ for /list types/ means:
     Two types ~S~ and ~T~. If ~S~ is a subtype of ~T~, then ~List[S]~ is a
     subtype of ~List[T]~.

   - Since the /convariant/ property, ~List()~ is of type ~List[Nothing]~.

   - Because lists are /covariant/, it follows that ~List[Nothing]~ is a subtype
     of ~List[T]~ for ANY type ~T~.

     #1 must be explicitly typed
     + The ~msort~ method needs to be instantiated with a type parameter before
       it can be applied to its arguments.

   - This inference scheme suggests the following *library design principle*:
     When designing a /polymorphic method/ that takes
     1. some /non-function arguments/
        and
     2. a /function argument/, place the function argument last in a curried
        parameter list on its own.

     That way, the method's correct instance type can be inferred from the
     non-function arguments, and that type can in turn be used to type check the
     function argument.
       The net effect is that users of the method will be able to give less type
     information and write function literals in more compact ways.

*** DONE List buffers
    CLOSED: [2017-11-01 Wed 03:41]
    - ~List~ has its limitation -- if you want to append element to the end of a
      /list/, you can append to the head, and ~reverse~ at the end.

    - Another alternative, which avoid ~reverse~, is to use a ~ListBuffer~.
      ~ListBuffer~ is a mutable object (contained in package
      ~scala.collection.mutable~), which can help you build lists more
      efficiently when you need to _append_ -- constant time _append_ and
      _prepend_ operations:

      + append operator: ~+=~
      + prepend operator: ~+=:~

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer

        val buf = new ListBuffer[Int]
        buf += 1
        buf += 2
        buf
        //  buf.type = ListBuffer(1, 2)

        3 +=: buf
        buf
          //  buf.type = ListBuffer(3, 1, 2)

        buf.toList
        // List[Int] = List(3, 1, 2)
      #+END_SRC

    - Another reason to use ListBuffer instead of List is to _prevent_ the
      _potential for stack overflow_.

      If you can build a /list/ in the desired order by _prepending_, but the
      recursive algorithm that would be required is _NOT tail recursive_, you can
      use a ~for~ expression or ~while~ loop and a ~ListBuffer~ instead. You'll
      see ~ListBuffer~ being used in this way in Section 22.2.

*** DONE Sorted sets and maps
    CLOSED: [2017-11-03 Fri 22:15]
    - For the purpose of use a map or a set in a particular order, the Scala
      ~collections~ library provides /traits/ ~SortedSet~ and ~SortedMap~.
      These /traits/ are implemented by classes ~TreeSet~ and ~TreeMap~, which
      use a /red-black tree/ to keep /elements/ (in the case of ~TreeSet~) or
      /keys/ (in the case of ~TreeMap~) in order.

    - The order is determined by the ~Ordered~ trait, which the element type of
      the set, or key type of the map, must either mix in or be implicitly
      convertible to.

    - These classes ONLY come in _immutable_ variants.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala

** DONE 17.3 Selecting mutable versus immutable collections - 385
   CLOSED: [2017-11-03 Fri 23:27]
   - When you don't know, choose /immutable collections/ first.

   - When you don't want copy, use /mutable collections/.

   - /immutable collections/ is more efficient in using space.
     For example,
     + an empty mutable map in its default representation of ~HashMap~ takes up
       about 80 bytes, and about 16 more are added for each entry that's added to
       it.

       An empty immutable ~Map~ is a single object that's share between all
       references, so referring to it essentially costs just a single pointer
       field.

     + The Scala CURRENTLY store /immutable collections/ with up to four entries
       in a single object, which typically takes up between 16 and 40 bytes,
       depending on the number of entires stored in the collection.

       Conclusion: So for _SMALL_ maps and sets, the /immutable/ versions are
       much _more compact than_ the /mutable/ ones.

   - Scala provides some syntactic sugar.
     Whenever you write ~a += b~, and ~a~ does NOT support ~a~ method named +=,
     Scala will try interpreting it as ~a = a + b~.

     =From Jian= DO NOT use this feature. It misleading to the reader.

     + tail :: returns a queue without its first element
     + enqueue ::  returns a new queue with a given element appended at the end

*** DONE Private constructors and factory methods
    CLOSED: [2017-11-04 Sat 16:19]
    - A /primary constructor/ is the base of a class, but some /primary
      constructors/ do NOT work in a natural way from the client's point of view,
      and they need to be hidden and called the other /constructors/.

    - The /primary constructor/ in Scala does NOT have an explicit definition,
      and we can use Java-like syntax to make it private, but we have similar
      syntax:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala

          private val leading: List[T],
          private val trailing: List[T]

    - After _hiding_ the /primary constructor/, you need a /constructor/ for the
      client.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        // #0

      + With the ~apply~ method, from the client' point of view, construct an
        instance of a class is like to call a globally defined factory method,
        though Scala has no globally visible methods -- ~Queue(1, 2, 3)~ is
        expanded to ~Queue.apply(1, 2, 3)~ automatically.

*** DONE An alternative: private classes
    CLOSED: [2017-11-04 Sat 16:27]
    - /Private constructors/ and /private members/ are one way to _hide_ the
      initialization and representation of a class.

      Another more radical way is to _hide_ the class itself and only /export a
      trait/ that reveals the public interface of the class.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        trait Queue[T] {
          def head: T
          def tail: Queue[T]

          private class QueueImpl[T](
            private val leading: List[T],

** DONE 19.3 Variance annotations - 425
   CLOSED: [2017-11-05 Sun 03:42]
   - /Type constructor/, /generic trait/

   - /variance/:
     + /covariant/, ~+~ type prefix

     + /nonvariant/

     + /contravariant/, ~-~ type prefix

   - The ~+~ and ~-~ symbols that can prefix a type parameter are called
     /variance annotations/.

   - =IMPORTANT=
     In a purely functional world, many types are _naturally_ /covariant/
     (flexible).

     However, the situation changes once you introduce mutable data.

*** Variance and arrays
    - Scala treats arrays as /nonvariant/ (rigid)

    - Java didn't have /generics/ before Java 5.

      To have a simple means to treat arrays generically, Java language decides
      to treat its ~Array~ as /covariant/, though some operations lead to runtime
      errors. For example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC java
        String[] a1 = { "abc" };
        Object[] a2 = a1;
        a2[0] = new Integer(17);
        String s = a1[0];

        // // Runtime Error
        // //
        // Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayStoreException:
        // java.lang.Integer
        //         at JavaArrays.main(JavaArrays.java:8)
      #+END_SRC

      After having /generics/, there is a simple mean to treat arrays generical-
      ly. The /covariant/ property of ~Array~'s still exist just for
      compatibility.

    - =IMPORTANT=
      Since Scala treats arrays as /nonvariant/ (rigid), so an ~Array[String]~ is
      _NOT_ considered to conform to an ~Array[Any]~.

      Sometimes it is necessary to interact with legacy methods in Java that use
      an ~Object~ array as a means to emulate a generic array. For instance, you
      might want to call a ~sort~ method like the one described previously with
      an array of ~String~'s as argument. To make this possible, Scala lets you
      cast an array of ~T~'s to an array of any supertype of ~T~:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        val a2: Array[Object] =
          a1.asInstanceOf[Array[Object]]

        // a2: Array[Object] = Array(abc)
      #+END_SRC
      The cast is always legal at compile-time, and it will always succeed at
      runtime because the JVM’s underlying run-time model treats arrays as
      covariant, just as Java the language does. But you might get ArrayStore
      exceptions afterwards, again just as you would in Java.

   Syntax: ~for ( seq ) yield expr~

   - Here, ~seq~ is a sequence of /generators/, /definitions/, and /filters/,
     with semicolons between successive elements.

   - Enclose the ~seq~ in /braces/ instead of /parentheses/. Then the semicolons
     become _optional_:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       for (p <- persons; n = p.name; if (n startsWith "To"))
       yield n

     + A /generator/ is of the form: ~pat <- expr~

       be proved a good feature)

       * the most common case: a variable. Then simply iterates over all elements

     + If there are multiple generators, later ones are for inner iterations.

       good idea.

   CLOSED: [2017-10-21 Sat 18:59]
   - There are many things you can do with a program _other than_ compiling and
     running it. Some examples are:
     1. Automatic generation of documentation as with *Scaladoc*.
        =TODO=

     2. Pretty printing code so that it matches your preferred style.
        =TODO=

     3. Checking code for common errors such as opening a file but, on some
        control paths, never closing it.
        =TODO=

     4. Experimental type checking, for example to manage side effects or ensure
        ownership properties.
        =TODO=

   - Such tools are called /meta-programming/ tools, because they are programs
     that take other programs as input.

   - /Annotations/ can improve the previously listed tools as follows:
     1. A documentation generator could be instructed to document certain methods
        as _deprecated_.

     2. A pretty printer could be instructed to skip over parts of the program
        that have been carefully hand formatted.

     3. A checker for non-closed files could be instructed to ignore a particular
        file that has been manually verified to be closed.

     4. A side-effects checker could be instructed to verify that a specified
        method has no side effects.
        =TODO= =???=

** DONE 27.2 Syntax of annotations - 638
   CLOSED: [2017-10-21 Sat 18:59]
   - Annotations can also be applied to an expression, as with the ~@unchecked~
     annotation for pattern matching (see Chapter 15). To do so, place a colon
     (~:~) after the expression and then write the annotation. Syntactically, it
     looks like the annotation is being used as a type:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       (e: @unchecked) match {
         // nonexhaustive
         cases...
       }
     #+END_SRC

   - /Annotations/ have a richer general form: @annot(exp1, exp2, ...)
     Though much simpler form annotations are often seen.

   - Internally,
     Scala represents an annotation as just a constructor call of an annotation
     class -- replace the ~@~ by ~new~ and you have a valid instance creation
     expression.

   - One slightly tricky bit concerns annotations that conceptually take other
     annotations as arguments, which are required by some frameworks.

     You _CANNOT_ write an annotation directly as an argument to an annotation,
     because _annotations are NOT valid expressions_. In such cases you must use
     ~new~ instead of ~@~, as illustrated here:
     #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       scala> import annotation._
       // import annotation._

       scala> class strategy(arg: Annotation) extends Annotation
       // defined class strategy

       scala> class delayed extends Annotation
       // defined class delayed

       scala> @strategy(@delayed) def f() = {}
       // <console>:1: error: illegal start of simple expression
       //        @strategy(@delayed) def f() = {}
       //                  ˆ

       scala> @strategy(new delayed) def f() = {}
       // f: ()Unit
     #+END_SRC

** DONE 27.3 Standard annotations - 640
   CLOSED: [2017-10-21 Sat 18:45]
*** DONE Deprecation
    CLOSED: [2017-10-21 Sat 18:34]
    ~@deprecated~

    - ~@deprecated def bigMistake() = // ...~

    - With message (use this in most cases):
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        @deprecated("use newShinyMethod() instead")
        def bigMistake() = //...
      #+END_SRC

*** DONE Volatile fields
    CLOSED: [2017-10-21 Sat 18:39]
    ~@volatile~

    Scala's concurrency support is /message passing/ and a _minimum_ of /shared
    mutable state/. =TODO= See Chapter 32

    Nonetheless, sometimes programmers want to use /mutable state/ in their
    concurrent programs. The ~@volatile~ annotation helps in such cases.

    - The ~@volatile~ keyword gives different guarantees on different platforms.

      On the Java platform, however, you get the same behavior as if you wrote
      the field in Java code and marked it with the Java volatile modifier.

*** TODO Binary serialization
*** DONE Automatic ~get~ and ~set~ methods *RE-READ*
    CLOSED: [2017-10-21 Sat 18:45]
    Scala doesn't need ~get~ and ~set~ methods.
    Some platform-specific frameworks do expect ~get~ and ~set~ methods, however.

    Scala provides the ~@scala.reflect.BeanProperty~ annotation. It informs the
    compiler to generate ~get~ and ~set~ methods for you automatically. For
    example, ~getCrazy~ and ~setCrazy~ for a field named ~crazy~.

    =IMPORTANT= =RE-READ=
    The generated ~get~ and ~set~ methods are ONLY available _AFTER_ a compilation
    pass completes.

*** DONE Tailrec
    CLOSED: [2017-10-21 Sat 18:04]
    Use ~@tailrec~, and if the _optimization CANNOT be performed_, you will then
    get a warning together with an explanation of the reasons.

*** DONE Unchecked
    CLOSED: [2017-10-21 Sat 18:06]
    ~@unchecked~

    Tell the compiler don't worry if the ~match~ expression seems to leave out some cases.
    =TODO= See Section 15.5 for details.

*** TODO Native methods
    ~@native~

** TODO 27.4 Conclusion - 644
   =TODO=
   Chapter 31 gives additional, Java-specific information on annotations. It
   covers annotations only available when targeting Java, additional meanings of
   standard annotations when targeting Java, how to interoperate with Java-based
   annotations, and how to use Java-based mechanisms to define and process
   annotations in Scala.

* DONE Appendix A. Scala Scripts on Unix and Windows - 802
  CLOSED: [2017-10-03 Tue 21:25]
  - In a Unix flavor system:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      #!/bin/sh
      exec scala "$0" "$@"
      !#
      // Say hello to the first argument
      println("Hello, " + args(0) + "!")
    #+END_SRC
    1. ~$ chmod +x helloarg~
    2. ~$ ./helloarg globe~

    The output is =Hello, globe!=

    =From Jian=
    Start the JVM takes sometime.
    If you want to run this script for multiple times, read
    https://alvinalexander.com/scala/how-make-scala-shell-scripts-run-faster-with-savecompiled-argument
    However, this is NOT a real solution, just a kind of not-so-good walkaround.

  - =Question from Jian= =TODO= =???=
    Why can't I use ~#!/usr/bin/env bash~ as the first line?????

  - In Windows:
    1. Create a =helloarg.bat= file

    2. Add the code below to the top of this file, and then the scala code
       #+BEGIN_SRC bat
         ::#!
         @echo off
         call scala %0 %*
         goto :eof
         ::!#
       #+END_SRC

       =TODO= 
       =From Jian= I never tried this. Try it later.
