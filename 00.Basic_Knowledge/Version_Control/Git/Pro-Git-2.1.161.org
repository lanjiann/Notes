*** DONE Snapshots, Not Differences  13
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 04:18]
    - /The other VCS/ (/Subversion/ and friends included) store info as a list of
      file-based changes.

      These systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the
      info they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over
      time.

    - /Git/ thinks about its data more like a _stream of snapshots_.
      NO-change files won't be save again, only create a link to it.

*** DONE Nearly Every Operation Is Local - 14
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 04:21]
    This is also the main difference between /Git/ and the other VCS's.

*** DONE Git Has Integrity - 15
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 04:37]
    - Everything in Git is _check-summed_ before it is stored and is then
      referred to by that /checksum/ -- impossible to make change without Git
      knowing about it.

    - Git uses SHA-1 hash for this checksumming (40-character hex).

*** DONE Git Generally Only Adds Data - 15
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 04:42]
    As in any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you haven't committed yet;
    but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose.

    =TODO= Any exception.

*** DONE The Three States - 15
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 05:05]
    Git has _THREE_ main states that your file can reside in:
    + /committed/ :: the data is safely stored in your local database.
    + /modified/ :: file(s) has/have been changed but _NOT_ committed.
    + /staged/ :: marked a /modified/ file in its current version to go
                  into your next commit snapshot.

    See Figure 1-6. (page 8)

    This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project:
    + the =.git= directory (Repository):
      _where_ Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.
      This is _the most important part_ of Git, and it is what is copied when you
      clone a repository from another computer.

    + the working directory:
      a single checkout of one version of the project.
      These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory
      and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

    + the staging area:
      a file, generally contained in your =.git= directory, that stores
      information about what will go into your next commit. It's sometimes
      referred to as the "index", but it's also common to refer to it as the
      staging area.

* TODO 2. Git Basics - 25
  If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it.

  - By the end of the chapter, you should be able to:
    + configure and initialize a repository
    + begin and stop tracking files
    + stage and commit changes
    + set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns
    + undo mistakes quickly and easily
    + browse the history of your project and view changes between commits
    + push and pull from remote repositories

** DONE 2.1 Getting a Git Repository - 25
   CLOSED: [2017-07-15 Sat 14:07]
   Two main approaches:
   1. The first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git.
   2. The second clones an existing Git repository from another server.

** DONE 2.2 Recording Changes to the Repository - 27
   CLOSED: [2019-08-19 Mon 00:21]
   - Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states:
     + tracked
     + untracked

   - _Tracked files_ are files that were in the last snapshot;
     They can be
     + unmodified
     + modified
     + staged.

   - _Untracked files_ are everything else -- any files in your working directory
     that were
     + NOT in your last snapshot
     + NOT in your staging area

   - Figure 2-1. The lifecycle of the status of your files
     _Untracked_ ------> _Unmodified_ ------> _Modified_ -------> _Staged_

*** DONE Checking the Status of Your Files - 27
    CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:58]
    ~git status~

*** DONE Tracking New Files - 28
    CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 22:58]
    ~git add [<filename(s)> | <directory>]~
    ~git add~ works recursively.

*** DONE Staging Modified Files - 29
    CLOSED: [2017-07-16 Sun 23:10]
    - ~git add~ is a multipurpose command -- you use it
      + to begin tracking new files
      + to stage files
      + to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. =TODO=

    - It may be helpful to think of it
      _more as_ "add this content to the next commit"
      _rather than_ "add this file to the project".

    - A file can be /staged/ and /unstaged/ simutaneously:
      If you staged a change in a file and modified this file again before
      committing, then this file is marked as /staged/ and /unstaged/, which
      actually means some change is /staged/ and some change is /unstaged/.

*** DONE Short Status - 30
    CLOSED: [2019-05-21 Tue 15:53]
    - Command:
      ~git status --short~ or ~git status -s~

    - Case study:
      #+BEGIN_SRC text
         M README
        MM Rakefile
        A  lib/git.rb
        M  lib/simplegit.rb
        ?? LICENSE.txt
      #+END_SRC
      + _??_ : _untracked_ file
      + _A _: new files that have been added to the staging area have an A,
      + M: modified files have an M and so on.
           There are _TWO columns_ to the output --
        * left column: the file is staged
        * right column: the file is modified

    - So for example in that output,
      + =README=
        is _modified_ in the working directory but _not yet staged_,

      + =lib/simplegit.rb=:
        is _modified_ and _staged_.

      + =Rakefile=:
        was _modified_, _staged_ and then _modified again_, so there are
        changes to it that are _BOTH staged and unstaged_.

*** DONE Ignoring Files - 31
    CLOSED: [2019-05-21 Tue 16:59]
    Use =.gitignore= file to tell git the files you don't want to track or even
    show.

    - You usually don't want to see some automatically

    - The _rules for the patterns_ you can put in the =.gitignore= file are as follows:
      + Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.

      + Standard glob patterns =???= work, and will be applied _recursively throughout
        the entire working tree_.

      + You can _start_ patterns with a forward slash (/) to *AVOID recursivity*.

      + You can _end_ patterns with a forward slash (/) to _specify a directory_.

      + You can _negate_ a pattern by _starting_ it with an exclamation point (~!~).

    - Glob patterns are LIKE _simplified regular expressions_ that shells use.
      + ~*~ matches zero or more characters

      + ~[abc]~ matches any character inside the brackets (in this case ~a~, ~b~,
        or ~c~)

      + ~?~ matches a single character

      + Patterns like ~[0-9]~ matches any character between them _inclusively_

      + ~**~ matches _nested directories_.
        For instance, ~a/**/z~ would match ~a/z~, ~a/b/z~, ~a/b/c/z~, and so on.

    - Case Study:
      #+begin_src gitignore
        # ignore all .a files
        ,*.a

        # but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
        !lib.a

        # only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
        /TODO

        # ignore all files in any directory named build
        build/

        # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
        doc/*.txt

        # ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
        doc/**/*.pdf
      #+end_src

    - *Tips*
       GitHub maintains a fairly comprehensive list of good =.gitignore= file
       examples for dozens of projects and languages at
      https://github.com/github/gitignore.
      _Pick one at the start point of your project._

    - *CAUTION*
      You can have only one =.gitignore= in the root of your simple project.
      However, it is also possible to have _ADDITIONAL_ =.gitignore= files in
      subdirectories.
        The rules in these nested =.gitignore= files apply only to the files
      under the directory where they are located.

      Use ~man gitignore~ for the details.

*** DONE Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes - 32
    CLOSED: [2019-08-19 Mon 00:20]
    ~git diff~ show more details than ~git status~.
    - ~git diff~ shows you the exact lines added and removed -- the patch, as it
      were.

    - You probably use ~git diff~ most often to answer two questions:
      + Q :: What have you changed but not yet staged? --
             =from Jian= compare _not staged changes_ with branch head.

      + Q :: What have you staged that you are about to commit? --
             =from Jian= compare _staged changes_ with branch head.

    - For example,
      _edited and staged_ =README= and _edited_ =CONTRIBUTING.md=
      + ~git diff~ compare =CONTRIBUTING.md= with branch head
      + ~git diff --staged~ compare =README= with branch head

    - *Git Diff in an External Tool*
      - If you want to view the differences in diff viewing program, use ~git
        difftool~ instead.

      - Run ~git difftool --tool-help~ to see what is available on your system.

*** DONE Committing Your Changes - 35
    CLOSED: [2019-05-21 Tue 17:11]
    - Command:
      + ~git commit~:
        usually open the editor ~git config --global core.editor~, and you can
        type the commit message inside it. You will see it automatically put the
        change info in the comment. You can keep it or delete it.

      + ~git commit -v~:
        Just like the command above, but in verbose mode -- the comment includes
        more info like the diff result.

      + ~git commit -m~:
        Do not open editor, and provide a inline message that follows the ~-m~
        parameter.

    - After committing, you'll see an SHA-1 checksum.
      =TODO= SHA-1???

*** DONE Skipping the Staging Area - 36
    CLOSED: [2019-05-21 Tue 17:23]
    You can use a ~-a~ option when you work with ~git commit~ command, and
    _AUTOMATICALLY /stage/ EVERY file that is already tracked_ before doing the
    commit.
    For instance, ~git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks~

    This is convenient, but it can also mass up your commit if you don't pay
    enough attension or overuse it.

*** DONE Removing Files - 37
    CLOSED: [2019-08-18 Sun 00:11]
    ~git rm~
    - If you delete a file with using ~git rm~,
      ~git stauts~ will tell you =Changes not staged for commit=
      + To stage it, you need use ~git rm <filename>~ again, even if you can't
        see the deleted file(s) in your repo.

      + If you use ~git rm~ from the very beginning, you need need to run
        ~rm <filename>~ followed by ~git rm <filename>~.

    - After running ~git rm <filename>~, the next time you commit, the file will
      be gone and no longer tracked.

    - ~git rm -f~
      If you _modified the file_ or _had already added it to the staging area_,
      you *MUST FORCE* the removal with the ~-f~ option.
      + Rationale:
        This is a *safety feature* to PREVENT
        _accidental removal of data that hasn't yet been recorded in a snapshot
        and that can't be recovered from Git._

    - ~git rm --cached~ remove file(s) from your /staging area/ but keep the file(s)
      in your working tree -- no longer track it.
      + This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your
        =.gitignore= file and accidentally staged it.

    - With file-glob patterns:
      ~git rm log/\*.log~
      The backslash (~\~) here is used to escape the ~*~ to stop doing shell
      expansion, and pass ~*~ to git, who has its own expansion.
      + =from Jian=
        Shell expansion also works. However, since I don't know the differences,
        and I believe let git to all the operations it can do is good for
        version control.

*** DONE Moving Files - 38
    CLOSED: [2019-08-17 Sat 22:01]
    - _UNLIKE_ many other VCS systems,
      Git does *NOT explicitly track* file movement.

    - If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you
      renamed the file.
        However, _Git is pretty smart about figuring that out after the fact_ --
      TODO we'll deal with detecting file movement a bit later.

    - Git has a ~mv~ command. For example,
      #+begin_src bash
        git mv README.md README
      #+end_src
      Then, run ~git status~ and you'll see:
      #+begin_src text
        On branch master
        Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
        Changes to be committed:
          (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

            renamed:    README.md -> README
      #+end_src

    - Git has a ~mv~ command (e.g. ~git mv README.md README~), which is equivalent
      to running something like:
      #+begin_src bash
        mv README.md README  # Or any other ways, like in GUI, you can use to rename a file
        git rm README.md
        git add README
      #+end_src
      + _The only real difference is that ~git mv~ is one command instead of three._

      + The three commands way is still useful:
        you can use any tool you like to rename (shell's ~mv~, GUI, etc.) a file,
        and address the add/rm (~git add~ and ~git rm~) later, before you commit.

    - *CAUTION*:

      Any local changes you made to that file are gone -- _Git just replaced that
      file with the most recently-committed version._
      *Don't ever use this command unless you absolutely know that you don't want
      those unsaved local changes.*

      + =from Jian= To avoid this,
        * Solution 1:
          Add a hook for this command with reminder

        * Solution 2: =from Jian= I prefer this!!!
          Add a hook for this command without reminder, but implicitly
          create a branch with snapshot before this command.

        * Solution 3:
          Manually create a branch with snapshot before this command, and then
          switch back and run this command.

      + =from Jian=
        I prefer Solution 2, and we should add hooks to all the dangerous
        commands!!!

    - *Remember*: =IMPORTANT=
      + _Anything that is committed in Git can almost always be recovered._
        Even commits that were on branches that were deleted or commits that
        were overwritten with an ~--amend~ commit can be recovered (see Data
        Recovery for data recovery).

      + However, _anything you lose that was never committed is likely never to be
        seen again._
