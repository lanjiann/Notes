   - Design Patterns (The formal definition) ::
        A design pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem in
        software design. It is not a finished piece of code but a template that
        helps to solve a particular problem or family of problems.

   - Feature-rich languages might not even need a /design pattern/, while others
     still do.

   - The lack or existence of a certain functionality within aprogramming language
     also makes it able to implement additional /design patterns/ that others
     cannot. The opposite is also valid -- it might not be able to implement
     things that others can.

*** DONE Scala and design patterns
    CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 11:54]
    - The hybrid nature of the Scala makes some of the /traditional object-oriented
      design patterns/ _obsolete_, or possible, using _other cleaner techniques_.

*** DONE The need for design patterns and their benefits

   CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 12:45]
   - Even if there are many different /design patterns/, they can all be grouped
     in the following:
     + Creational

     + Structural

     + Behavioral

     + Functional

     + Scala-specific design patterns
       * Some of these /design patterns/ can be assigned to the previous groups.
         - They can either be _additions_ or _replacements_ of the already
           existing ones.

         - They are typical to Scala and take advantage of some advanced language
           features or simply features not available in other languages.)

   - The _first three groups_ contain the famous /Gang of Four design patterns/.

     The rest, even if they can be assigned to one of the first three groups, will
     be specific to Scala and functional programming languages.

     =TODO=
     In the next few subsections, we will explain the main characteristics of
     the listed groups and briefly present the actual design patterns that fall
     under them.

*** TODO Creational design patterns
    - The /creational design patterns/ deal with /object creation mechanisms/.

      + *PURPOSE*: create objects in a way that is suitable to the current situation,
        which could lead to unnecessary complexity and the need for extra
        knowledge if they were not there.

      + The main ideas behind the /creational design patterns/ are as follows:
        * *Knowledge encapsulation* about the concrete classes

        * *Hiding details* about the actual creation and how objects are combined

**** TODO The abstract factory design pattern
**** TODO The factory method design pattern
**** TODO The lazy initialization design pattern
**** TODO The singleton design pattern
**** TODO The object pool design pattern
**** TODO The builder design pattern
**** TODO The prototype design pattern

*** TODO Structural design patterns
    - /Structural design patterns/ exist in order to help establish the
      relationships between different entities in order to _form larger
      structures_.

        They define how each component should be structured so that it has very
      flexible interconnecting modules that can work together in a larger
      system.

    - The main features of /structural design patterns/ include the following:
      + The use of composition to combine the implementations of multiple objects

      + Help build a large system made of various components by maintaining a high
        level of flexibility

**** TODO The adapter design pattern
**** TODO The decorator design pattern
**** TODO The bridge design pattern

*** TODO Behavioral design patterns
    - /Behavioral design patterns/ increase *communication flexibility* between
      objects based on the specific ways they interact with each other.

      Here,
      + /creational patterns/ mostly describe a moment in time during creation,
      + /structural patterns/ describe a more or less static structure,
      + /behavioral patterns/ describe a process or flow.

      They simplify this flow and make it more understandable.

    - The main features of /behavioral design patterns/ are as follows:
      + What is being described is a process or flow

      + The flows are simplified and made understandable

      + They accomplish tasks that would be difficult or impossible to achieve
        with objects

     - Concept

     - What is important about /monoids/ is that
       + they give us the possibility to work with many different types of values
         in a common way.

       + They allow us to convert pairwise operations to *work with sequences*;
       + the /associativity/ gives us the possibility for *parallelization*
       + the /identity element/ allows us to know what to do with empty lists.

       /Monoids/ are *GREAT to EASILY* _describe and implement *aggregations*._

**** DONE Monads
     CLOSED: [2018-05-29 Tue 12:37]
     - /Monads/ are algebraic structures that REPRESENT _computations as sequences
       of steps_.

     - /Monads/ are useful for
       + building pipelines

       + adding operations with side effects cleanly to a language where everything
         is immutable

       + implementing compositions.

   - About how to *use* /a design pattern/ or *combine* /design patterns/, you
     should consider (this is BY NO MEANS an exhaustive list of questions):
     + Is this piece of code
       going to be _fairly static_ OR will it _change in the future_?

     + Do we have to _dynamically decide_ what /algorithms/ to use?

     + Is our code going to be _used by others_?

     + Do we have an agreed /interface/?

     + _What libraries_ are we planning to use, if any?

     + Are there any _special performance requirements or limitations_?

   - In the rest of the chapters, we will try to give specific recommendations
     about _when a /design pattern/ should and should NOT be used._ =TODO=

    From the example, you see:
    - *Unifying classes and functions* leads to _increased expressivity_
      and
      + we can easily achieve various things such as /callbacks/, /lazy parameter
        evaluation/, /centralized exception handling/, and others,

* TODO 4. Abstract and Self Types
  - Designing and writing high-quality code in software engineering is important
    in order to have applications that are easy to extend and maintain.

    This activity requires the
    + domain to be well-known, correctly understood by a developer
    + the requirements for the application to be well-defined.

    If any of these are absent, then writing good programs becomes quite
    challenging.

  - We will look into the following topics in this chapter:
    + Abstract types
    + Polymorphism
    + Self types

  - This chapter can by itself help you writing good code.

  - This chapter is useful when we start looking into some of the concrete
    design patterns.

** TODO Abstract types
   We can _parameterize classes by using values_ -- instantiate a class with
   different values to get different instances -- just the construction
   parameters.

   For example, pass different names (string values) to ~case class Person(name:
   String)~.

*** DONE Generics
    CLOSED: [2018-09-21 Fri 17:04]
    - /Generics/ are another way of _parameterizing classes_.

    - The most signatures example of using /generics/ to _parameterizing
      classes_ is the collection types.

    - Example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        trait Adder {
          def sum[T](a: T, b: T)(implicit numeric: Numeric[T]): T =
            numeric.plus(a, b)
        }
      #+END_SRC

    - *ad hoc polymorphism*
      =TODO=
      =???=

*** TODO Abstract types
    - Another way to _parameterize classes is by using /abstract types/._

      /Generics/ have their counterparts in other languages such as Java.
      _UNLIKE them_, however, /abstract types/ do *not* exist in Java.
