* foreword
  - _It would be nice_ if we could distinguish pure and impure functions in
    Scala,
    (but) I believe we _have not yet found_ a way to do so that is lightweight
    and flexible enough to be added to Scala without hesitation.

** DONE 1  What is functional programming? _PAGE 3 ~ 13_
   CLOSED: [2017-03-15 Wed 21:01]
   - A function has a /side effect/ if it does something
     /other than simply return a result/, for example:
     + Modifying a variable
     + Modifying a data structure in place
     + Setting a field on an object
     + Throwing an exception or halting with an error =TODO=
     + Printing to the console or reading user input
     + Reading from or writing to a file
     + Drawing on the screen

   - Q: Then how is it even possible to write useful programs at all?
     A: functional programming
     + is _a restriction on_ _HOW_ we write programs,
     + but _not_ on _WHAT_ programs we can express.

   - Over the course of this book, we'll learn how to express all of our
     programs without side effects, and that includes programs that perform I/O,
     handle errors, and modify data.

   - _tremendously beneficial_ of FP: the increase in /modularity/

   - Because the increased /modularity/, pure functions are easier to
     + test
     + reuse
     + parallelize
     + generalize
     + reason about

   - /referential transparency/

   - /the substitution model/

*** 1.1 The benefits of FP: a simple example
**** 1.1.1 A program with side effects
**** 1.1.2 A functional solution: removing the side effects
     - FP is a truly radical shift in _how programs are organized_
       at every level -- _from_ the simplest of loops _to_ high-level program
       architecture_.
*** 1.2 Exactly what is a (pure) function?
    - ~A => B~ is pronounced as "A to B" or "A arrow B".

    - A function has _NO observable effect_ on the execution of the program
      _other than_ to compute a result given its inputs;
      we say that it has _no side effects_.

    - /Referential transparency (RT)/ :: An expression e is referentially trans-
         parent if, for all programs p, all occurrences of e in p can be replaced
         by the result of evaluating e without affecting the meaning of p.

    - /purity/ :: A function f is /pure/ if the expression f(x) is referentially
                  transparent for all referentially transparent x.

*** 1.3 Referential transparency, purity, and the substitution model
    - Referential transparency _force/enables_ /substitution model/

    - Computation proceeds by applying /substitution model/ (substituting
      /equals for equals/).
        In other words, RT enables /equational reasoning/ about programs.

    - Two examples,
      1. a RT example
      2. a non-RT example

    - RT featured code a purely local, and we NEED NOT mentally simulate
      sequences of state updates to understand the code. ONLY /local reasoning/.

    - RT => pure locality (only the expression being evaluated) => /modularity/
                                                                        |
                                                                        V
                                                                 /composability/ 

    - A pure function is /modular/ and /composable/
      because it _separates_
      the logic of the computation itself
                   _from_
      “what to do with the result” and “how to obtain the input”; it's a black
      box.

    - From the process of eliminating the side effect from the ~buyCoffee~
      example, we were more easily to be able to reuse the logic of the function,
      both for purposes of _testing_ and for purposes of _further composition_.

    CLOSED: [2017-03-15 Wed 21:37]
    - A method of ~String~: ~format~ with C language like placeholder.

    - If you're familiar with Java,
      declaring an ~object~ in Scala
      is a lot _like_
      creating a _new instance of an anonymous class_.

    - Scala has no equivalent to Java's ~static~ keyword, and ~object~ is often
      used in Scala where you might use a class with static members in Java.

    - /left-hand side/ or /signature/: the part of declaration _before_ the
      equals sign.

    - /right-hand side/ or /definition/: the part of declaration _after_ the

**** 2.4.1 A short detour: writing loops functionally
     - /inner function (or local definition)/: functions that are local to the
       body of another function.
       =COMMENT= In functional programming, we shouldn't consider this a bigger
                 deal than local integers or strings

**** 2.4.2 Writing our first higher-order function
     - _Variable-naming conventions_: It's a common convention to use names like
       ~f~, ~g~, and ~h~ for parameters to a higher order function.
          In functional programming, we tend to use very short variable names,
       even one-letter names.

     - _Rationale to Variable-naming conventions_:
       + This is usually because HOFs are so general that they have no opinion
         on what the argument should actually do.
           All they know about the argument is its type.

       + Many functional programmers feel that short names make code easier to

         an ~apply~ method can be called _as if they were themselves methods_.

         * ~Function2~ is an oridinary (provided by the standard Scala library)
           trait, and it has an ~apply~ method. It represent function objects
           that take two arguments. Also provied are ~Function1~, ~Function3~,
           and others.
         * ~lessThan(10, 20)~ is REALLY syntatic sugar for calling its ~apply~
           method: ~lessThan.apply(10, 20)~
         * /first-class values/: ordinary Scala objects.
         * We'll often use /function/ to refer to either such a first-class

      For data types,

      + By placing it in the companion object, we can invoke it with syntax like
        ~List(1,2,3,4)~ or ~List("hi","bye")~, with as many values as we want
        separated by commas (we sometimes call this the /list literal/ or just

      + Variadic functions are just providing a little
        _syntactic sugar_
        for
        creating and passing a ~Seq~ of elements explicitly.

      + ~Seq~ is the interface in Scala's collections library implemented by
        sequence. Inside apply, the argument ~as~ will be bound to a ~Seq[A]~,

    - footnote 6:
      Conclusion: We find that _in the large_, FP can often achieve _greater_

       #+END_SRC
       The time complexity is O(a2.length)

     - If we were to implement this same function for two arrays, which is
       mutable in Scala,
       we'd be forced to _copy all_ the elements in both arrays into the result.
       In this case, the immutable linked list is much more efficient than an array!

     - Writing purely functional data structures that support different opera-
       tions efficiently
       _is all about finding clever ways to exploit data sharing_. =IMPORTANT=

     - Exercise 3.6,

       A: One ~case~ in pattern matching of this function body is
          ~case Cons(hd, tl) => Cons(hd, init(tl))~, which shows a copying
          operation and ~Cons~ construction.
          =Jian's Sentiment=: A linked list can be pointed by multiple head, but
                              it can't point to multiple tails.

   - The functional solution, of returning errors as values, is
     + safer and
     + retains referential transparency,
     and through the use of higher-order functions, we can preserve the

*** DONE 4.1 The good and bad aspects of exceptions
    CLOSED: [2017-03-19 Sun 23:05]
    - NO RT and substitution model can be applied:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      def failingFn(i: Int): Int = {
        val y: Int = throw new Exception("fail!")

        try {
          val x = 42 + 5
          x + y
        }
        catch { case e: Exception => 43 }
      }
      #+END_SRC

      is different from 
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      def failingFn(i: Int): Int = {
        try {
          val x = 42 + 5
          x + (throw new Exception("fail!"))
        }
        catch { case e: Exception => 43 }
      }
      #+END_SRC

    - There are two main problems with exceptions:
      1. /exceptions/ break /RT/ and
         introduce /context dependence/,
      2. Exceptions are not type-safe.
         For example: There is a function ~failingFn: Int => Int~.
         * It tells us nothing about the facct that  exceptions may occur.
         * It doesn't force us to handle those exceptions.
         * If we forget to check for an exception in ~failingFn~, this won't be
           detected until runtime.

    - _Checked exceptions_: Java's checked exceptions
      + GOOD: _at least_ force a decision about whether to handle or reraise an
        error

      + BAD:
        * significant boilerplate for callers

        * Don't work for higher-order functions. For example:
          #+BEGIN_SRC scala
          def map[A,B](l: List[A])(f: A => B): List[B] = {
            // ...
          }
          #+END_SRC
          This ~map~ doesn't know what exceptions were possible be thrown by ~f~.

    - _Primary benefit of exceptions_
      They allow us to /consolidate/ and /centralize error-handling/ _logic_,

    - The technique we use is based on an old idea:
      _instead of throwing_ an exception,
      _we return a value_ indicating that an exceptional condition has occurred.
      This is like the return codes in the C language.

    - However, unlike C-style error codes,
      + the error-handling strategy we use is /completely type-safe/, and
      + we get full assistance from the type-checker in forcing us to deal with
        errors,
      + with a minimum of syntactic noise.

*** DONE 4.2 Possible alternatives to exceptions
    CLOSED: [2017-03-19 Sun 23:05]
    - /partial function/: it's not defined for some inputs.

    - A function is _typically partial_
      because it _makes some assumptions_ about its inputs that aren't implied by
      the input types.

    - One "solution" is to return some sort of bogus value of its type, this is
      how error handling is often doen in languages without exceptions.
      We _REJECT_ this solution for a few reasons:
      1. It allows errors to silently propagate
         * Callers should check this condition manually, but they may forget
           (error-prone).
         * If a caller forgets to check this, compiler won't alert because the
           returned value is legal.
         * Often the error won't be detected until much later in the code.

      2. It a caller do the right thing to check the error codes, he/she at same
         time introduces a fair amout of boilerplate code at each errorcode-check
         required call site.

      3. It's not applicable to polymorphic code. You can't find a proper value
         for all possible types of the type variable ~A~.
         _NOTE_: ~null~ doesn't work for primitive types.

      4. It demands a special policy or calling convention of callers --
         proper use of this kind of functions would require that callers do
         something other than call mean and make use of the result.
           Giving functions special policies like this makes it difficult to
         pass them to higher-order functions, which must treat all arguments
         uniformly.

    - The second possibile "solution" is to force the call to supply an argument
      that tells us what to do in case we don't know how to handle the input,
      for example:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      def mean_1(xs: IndexedSeq[Double], onEmpty: Double): Double =
        if (xs.isEmpty) onEmpty
        else xs.sum / xs.length
      #+END_SRC
      It has drawbacks: it requires that
      1. immediate callers have direct knowledge of how to handle the undefined
         case
         and
      2. limits them to returning a ~Double~ (the type of the addtional argument).
           What if ~mean_1~ is called as part of a larger computation and we'd
         like to abort that computation if mean is undefined?
         Or
           perhaps we'd like to take some completely different branch in the
         larger computation in this case?

         Simply passing an ~onEmpty~ parameter doesn't give us this freedom.

*** TODO 4.3 The ~Option~ data type
    - The solution is to represent explicitly in the return type that a function
      may not always have an answer.
        We can think of this as _DEFERRING_ to the caller for the error-handling
      strategy.

***** USAGE SCENARIOS FOR THE BASIC OPTION FUNCTIONS
      - ~Option[A].map(f)~:
        1. proceeding with a computation on the assumption that an error hasn't
           occurred;
        2. deferring the error handling to later code.

      - ~Option[A].flatMap(f)~ is similar, except that the function we provide
        to transform the result can itself fail.

      - =TODO= EXERCISE 4.2: I don't like the anonymous function passed
        ~flatMap~ in this exercise -- it's too long to understand with
        only one glance.

      - We can use ~filter~ to convert successes into failures if the successful
        values don't match the given predicate

      - _A common pattern_:
        transform an ~Option~ via calls to ~map~, ~flatMap~, and/or ~filter~,
        and then
        use ~getOrElse~ to _do error handling_ at the end:
        #+BEGIN_SRC scala
        val dept: String =
          lookupByName("Joe").
          map(_.dept).
          filter(_ != "Accounting").
          getOrElse("Default Dept")
        #+END_SRC

      - ~orElse~: this is often useful when we need to _chain together possibly
        failing computations_, trying the second if the first hasn't succeeded.

      - A common idiom is to do ~o.getOrElse(throw new Exception("FAIL"))~ to convert
        the ~None~ case of an ~Option~ back to an exception.
        _The general rule of thumb_:
        We use exceptions _ONLY if NO REASONABLE program would ever catch the
        exception_.

      - _Note_:
        1. We don't have to check for ~None~ at each stage of the computation --
           we can apply several transformations and then check for and handle
           ~None~ when we're ready.

        2. But we _also get additional safety_:
           since ~Option[A]~ is a different type than ~A~, and
           the compiler won't let us forget to explicitly defer or handle the
           possibility of ~None~.

**** 4.3.2 ~Option~ composition, lifting, and wrapping exception-oriented APIs
     - /lift/:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       def lift[A, B](f: A => B): Option[A] => Option[B] = _ map f
       #+END_SRC

     - With ~lift~, any function that we already have lying around can be
       /lifted/ to operate within the context of a single ~Option~ value.
       For example,
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       val absO: Option[Double] => Option[Double] = lift(math.abs)
       #+END_SRC

     - =TODO= note

     - =TODO= Exercise 4.3  re-read the given answer

     - =TODO= Exercise 4.4

     - =TODO= Exercise 4.5

     - _For-comprehensions_

     - =IMPORTANT=
       Between ~map~, ~lift~, ~sequence~, ~traverse~, ~map2~, ~map3~, and so on,
       you should _NEVER_ have to modify any existing functions to work with
       optional values.

*** TODO 4.4 The ~Either~ data type
    - The big idea in this chapter:
      we can represent failures and exceptions with ordinary values, and write
      functions that abstract out common patterns of error handling and recovery.

    - ~Option~ never tells you what when wrong, and it only tells there is no
      available value. Sometimes, we may need more information.

    - ~Either~ basic Definition:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      sealed trait Either[+E, +A]
      case class Left[+E](value: E) extends Either[E, Nothing]
      case class Right[+A](value: A) extends Either[Nothing, A]
      #+END_SRC

    - ~Either~ is also often used more generally to encode one of two
      possibilities in cases where it isn't worth defining a fresh data type.
      =TODO= We'll see some examples of this throughout the book.

    - ~Option~ and ~Either~ in the standard library
      + Read both API's in the Scala standard library.
      + ~Either~ doesn't define a right-biased ~flatMap~ directly like we do here
        (in this chapter).

    - =TODO= EXERCISE 4.6
    - =TODO= EXERCISE 4.7
    - =TODO= EXERCISE 4.8

*** TODO 4.5 Summary
    - The bigger idea:
      + represent exceptions _as ordinary values_ and
      + use higher-order functions to encapsulate common patterns of
        _handling_
        and
        _propagating_ errors.

    - =TODO= In the next chapter, we'll look more closely at why /non-strictness/
      is important and how it can buy us greater modularity and efficiency in our
      functional programs.

** DONE 5  Strictness and laziness _PAGE 64 ~ 77_
   CLOSED: [2017-03-22 Wed 21:40]
   - Inefficiency example:
     ~List(1,2,3,4).map(_ + 10).filter(_ % 2 == 0).map(_ * 3)~
     + _COMMENT_: During the calculation of this example, two temporary lists are
       created, and they are used once and discard immediately.
     + _QUESTION_: Can we create a more efficiency calculation about this, but
       keep the same highlevel composition style (Write a ~while~ loop can
       eliminate the intermediate temporary lists, but it won't retain the
       highlevel composition style)?
       
   - =From Jian=: I think _function composition_ is a good solution, but this
     chapter will talk about another solution: _non-strictness functions_.
     + _I THINK_ provide an example that can't be solved simply through function
       composition will be better.

     + _function composition_ solution: from the OPERATION viewpoint.

     + _non-strictness functions_ solution: from the
       * non-strictness DATA STRUCTION
       * non-strictness functions
       viewpoint.

   - We'll see that /non-strictness/ _is a fundamental technique_ for improving
     on the
     + efficiency and
     + modularity
     of functional programs in general.

*** 5.1 Strict and non-strict functions
    - Complete form:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      def if2[A](cond: Boolean, onTrue: () => A, onFalse: () => A): A =
        if (cond) onTrue() else onFalse()

      // call
      if2(a < 22,
        () => println("a"),
        () => println("b")
      )
      #+END_SRC

    - Syntactic Sugared form:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      def if2[A](cond: Boolean, onTrue: => A, onFalse: => A): A =
        if (cond) onTrue else onFalse 
      #+END_SRC

    - That is, Scala _won't (by default) cache_ the result of evaluating an
      argument.
        This is not a big trouble in strict evaluation, while it is a big
      trouble in no-strict evaluation. Use ~lazy~ to cache the value:
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      // uncached
      def maybeTwice2(b: Boolean, i: => Int) =
        if (b) i+i else 0
      
      // cached
      def maybeTwice2(b: Boolean, i: => Int) = {
        lazy val j = i
        if (b) j+j else 0
      }
      #+END_SRC

    - _Formal definition of strictness_
      If the evaluation of an expression runs forever or throws an error instead
      of returning a definite value, we say that the expression doesn't
      terminate, or that it evaluates to bottom.

    - /strictness/: A function f is strict if the expression f(x) evaluates to
      bottom for all x that evaluate to bottom.

    - Non-strict function in Scala takes its arguments by name rather than by
      value.

*** 5.2 An extended example: lazy lists
**** 5.2.1 Memoizing streams and avoiding recomputation
     - _CONVENTION_: /smart constructors/ typically lowercase the first letter of
       the corresponding data constructor.

     - Comparison of constructor ~Cons~ and the smart constructor ~cons~:
       #+BEGIN_SRC scala
       // #1
       val x = Cons(() => expensive(x), tl)
       val h1 = x.headOption
       val h2 = x.headOption
       
       // #2
       def cons[A] (hd: => A, tl: => Scream[A]): Stream[A] = {
         lazy val head = hd
         lazy val tail = tl
         Cons(() => head, () => tail)
       }
       #+END_SRC
       _Comment_:
       1. Evaluate the head twice
       2. When applying ~cons~, cache =head= and =tail= by ~lazy val~ through
          the first force.
          Subsequent forces will return the cached ~lazy val~'s.

     - The ~empty~ smart constructor just returns ~Empty~, but annotates ~Empty~
       as a ~Stream[A]~, which is better for type inference in some cases.
       + _footnote 4_: Recall that Scala uses subtyping to represent data
         constructors, but we almost always want to infer Stream as the type,
         not Cons or Empty. Making smart constructors that return the base type
         is a common trick. =TODO: Better for type inference for what???=

**** 5.2.2 Helper functions for inspecting streams
*** 5.3 Separating program description from evaluation
    - A major theme in functional programming:
      /separation of concerns/.

    - For example,
      1. First-class functions capture some computation in their bodies but only
         execute it once they receive their arguments.

      2. Used ~Option~ to capture the fact that an error occurred, where the
         decision of what to do about it became a separate concern.

      3. With ~Stream~, we're able to build up a computation that produces a
         sequence of elements without running the steps of that computation
         until we actually need those elements.

    - More generally speaking,
      laziness lets us _separate_
      + the description of an expression
        from
      + the evaluation of that expression.

    - This gives us a powerful ability:
      we may choose to describe a "larger" expression that we need, and
      then evaluate only a portion of it.

    - =From Jian=: This is powerfull because sometimes describe the WHOLE
      expression is simpler than decribe part of this expression. In another
      words,
      + The WHOLE expression contains the general calculation ONLY.
      + Part of the whole expression contains the general calculation and the
        boundary condition. In real calculation, put the boundary condition in
        operation may simplify the expression, though it depneds.

    - Lazy ~foldRight~ can deal with the case of terminating early.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      // Explicit recursion version
      def existExplicitRecur(p: A => Boolean): Boolean = this match {
        case Cons(h, t) => p(h()) || t().exists(p)
        case _ => false
      }

      // Lazy ```foldRight``` and ```exist``` implemented with this
      // ```foldRight```
      def foldRight[B] (z: => B) (f: (A, => B) => B): B =
        this match {
          case Cons(h, t) => f(h(), t().foldRight(z)(f))
          case _ => z
        }

      def exists(p: A => Boolean): Boolean =
        foldRight(false) ((a, b) => p(a) || b)
      #+END_SRC

    - Good Example: Listing 5.3 Program trace for Stream

    - This ~find~ is a method of ~Stream~, with the help of (lazy method) filter
      it only evaluate elements of ~this~ stream to the first founded element.
      #+BEGIN_SRC scala
      def find(p: A => Boolean): Option[A] =
        filter(p).headOption

* TODO PART 3 COMMON STRUCTURES IN FUNCTIONAL DESIGN - 173
** 10  Monoids 175
   - We'll see how /monoids/ are useful in _TWO_ ways:
     + they facilitate _parallel computation_ by giving us the freedom to break
       our problem into chunks that can be computed in parallel; and

     + they can be _composed to assemble_ complex calculations from simpler
       pieces.
    
*** 10.1 What is a monoid?
    - The _laws_ of /associativity/ and /identity/ are collectively called the
      /monoid laws/.

    - A /monoid/ consists of the following:
      + Some type =A=;
      + An associative binary operation, =op=, that takes two values of type =A=
        and combines them into one: ~op(op(x,y), z) == op(x, op(y,z))~ for any
        choice of ~x: A~, ~y: A~, ~z: A~;
      + A value, ~zero: A~, that is an identity for that operation:
        ~op(x, zero) \eq{} x~ and ~op(zero, x) == x~ for any ~x: A~.

    - _The purely abstract nature of an algebraic structure_

    - _Having versus being a monoid_
      - terminology :: type =A= forms a /monoid/ under the operations defined by
        the ~Monoid[A]~ instance.

    - Stated tersely,
      a /monoid/ is
      + a type
        together with
      + a binary operation (op) over that type,
      satisfying associativity and having an identity element (zero).
